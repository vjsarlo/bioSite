                                When creating magic every day for travelers from around the world is your career, you cannot help if your mind starts to wonder about the people you meet every day. 
                                As millions travel to a theme park to meet the character you are portraying, 
                                you start to find yourself wanting to meet the places they come from. 
                                What better way to do this than to continue your career with the company overseas? 
                                Kaley had the opportunity to discover the world while getting to create magic at the same time. 
                                While she was working in the Disney themes park in Shanghai, 
                                her personal magic was being inspired by the unearthed alleys and valleys spread across the new countries she was getting to visit. 
                                With a role model of Anthony Bourdain and an open mind, she let no time go to waste as she lived in Shanghai. 
                                Her days off lead to streets that tourist usually never visit, eating foods which could make you shudder in disgust, 
                                and flights to surrounding countries to see more of the unknown you can't find at home. 
                                As she took part and documented all of these events on her personal social media, 
                                she discovered an extreme interest from other people showing her that one could create a strong brand connected to other cultures. 
                                From this, Kaley now has a desire to  document the world, see the areas tourists donâ€™t ever travel to, and learn how each culture truly lives.
